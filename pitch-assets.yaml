    subheadline: "API-first platform automates financial reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems"
    body: |
      [City, Date] - Settler, a Reconciliation-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform, today 
      announced the launch of its API-first reconciliation platform. Settler automates 
      financial reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems, reducing 
      reconciliation time from hours to minutes with 99.9% accuracy.
      
      Modern businesses operate across 10+ platforms (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, NetSuite), 
      causing data fragmentation and reconciliation challenges. Settler solves this by providing 
      a single API that normalizes, validates, and reconciles data across all sources in 
      real-time, with instant logs, error handling, and compliance built-in.
      
      "We're making reconciliation as simple as sending an email," said Scott Hardie, Founder 
      and CEO of Settler. "Our API-first approach means developers can integrate in 5 minutes 
      instead of weeks of custom code."
      
      Settler's platform features:
      - API-first design (5-minute integration)
      - Real-time webhook reconciliation
      - Composable adapters (50+ platforms)
      - Compliance built-in (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
      - 99.9% accuracy with ML-powered matching
      
      The company has 50+ beta users and is targeting $600K ARR in Year 1. Settler is raising 
      a $2M Seed Round to accelerate product development and go-to-market.
