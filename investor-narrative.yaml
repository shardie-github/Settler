# Task B: Investor Storyteller - Narrative Architecture
# Generated: January 2026

task: "B"
executive_summary: "Crafted cohesive investor narrative across 6 chapters (Problem → Product → Traction → Market → Moat → Ask). Created 3 persona-tailored variants (Angels, Seed VCs, Payments Strategics) and 25 Q&A pairs. Core story: $88B reconciliation nightmare → Settler's API-native solution → $20B SAM → Triple moat → $15M Series A ask."

# B3. Q&A Bank
qa_bank:
  - question: "Why not just use Stripe + PayPal APIs directly?"
    answer: "Gateways expose raw events, not reconciled ledgers. Settler normalizes 50+ gateways into canonical events, runs ML-powered matching at <100ms, surfaces exceptions with 92% auto-resolution. You'd need weeks of custom code to replicate this."
  
  - question: "How is this different from QuickBooks reconciliation?"
    answer: "QuickBooks reconciliation is manual and batch-based. Settler is API-first, real-time, and automated. We integrate with QuickBooks (and 50+ other platforms) but provide the reconciliation engine that QuickBooks lacks."
  
  - question: "What if Stripe/Shopify builds this themselves?"
    answer: "They're payment platforms, not reconciliation platforms. Settler is platform-agnostic - we reconcile across Stripe, Shopify, PayPal, QuickBooks, NetSuite, and custom systems. Our composable adapter model means we can add any platform quickly."
  
  - question: "How do you compete with BlackLine?"
    answer: "BlackLine is enterprise-only ($100K+, months to onboard). Settler is developer-first ($49-$299/month, 5-minute integration). We're targeting the underserved SMB/mid-market segment with API-first approach."
  
  - question: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"
    answer: "Three-phase approach: (1) Developer-led growth (Product Hunt, technical content, communities), (2) Product-led growth (free tier, self-service onboarding), (3) Sales-assisted growth (enterprise, partnerships). Target: 1,000 users → 100 paying customers in Year 1."
  
  - question: "What's your churn rate?"
    answer: "Targeting <5% monthly churn (vs. industry 7-10%). Early signals: high activation rate (40%+ first reconciliation success), strong retention (70%+ Week 1). Reconciliation is sticky - once integrated, hard to replace."
  
  - question: "How do you handle compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)?"
    answer: "Compliance built-in from day one. GDPR ready (data export/deletion APIs). SOC 2 Type II certification by Month 9. PCI-DSS Level 1 by Month 12 (if required). We don't store card data - pass-through only."
  
  - question: "What's your unit economics?"
    answer: "Average customer: $50/month ACV, $300 CAC (6-month payback), $3,600 LTV (3-year average, 5% churn), 12x LTV:CAC ratio. Gross margin: 80%. Net margin: -20% Year 1 (investing in growth), 25% Year 3."
  
  - question: "How do you scale the matching engine?"
    answer: "Serverless infrastructure (Vercel, AWS Lambda) scales automatically. ML-powered matching runs at edge (<100ms p95). We use Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for persistence. Architecture designed for millions of transactions/month."
  
  - question: "What's your moat?"
    answer: "Triple moat: (1) Data - more transactions = better ML models, (2) Rules - domain expertise + configurable matching, (3) Network effects - more adapters → more customers → more adapters. Plus developer experience and compliance moats."
  
  - question: "Who are your competitors?"
    answer: "Legacy solutions (QuickBooks, Xero - manual, no API), enterprise solutions (BlackLine - expensive, complex), platform solutions (Stripe Revenue Recognition - single-platform), custom scripts (high maintenance). No API-first competitor."
  
  - question: "What's your pricing model?"
    answer: "Tiered SaaS: Free (1K/month), Starter $49 (10K/month), Growth $299 (100K/month), Enterprise custom (unlimited). Overage: $0.01 per reconciliation. Usage-based pricing aligns with value delivered."
  
  - question: "How do you handle multi-currency?"
    answer: "Built-in multi-currency support with FX conversion. We normalize all currencies to a base currency for matching, then convert back for reporting. Supports 150+ currencies with real-time exchange rates."
  
  - question: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"
    answer: "Phase 1: Developer-led (Product Hunt, technical content, communities). Phase 2: Product-led (free tier, self-service). Phase 3: Sales-assisted (enterprise, partnerships). Target: 1,000 users → 100 paying → $5K MRR in Year 1."
  
  - question: "How do you ensure accuracy?"
    answer: "ML-powered matching with configurable rules. 95%+ accuracy in beta, targeting 99%+ in production. Exception handling with 92% auto-resolution. Manual review queue for unmatched transactions. Complete audit trail."
  
  - question: "What's your customer support model?"
    answer: "Free: Community (Discord, GitHub). Starter: Email (24-hour response). Growth: Priority email (4-hour response). Enterprise: Dedicated account manager (1-hour SLA). Self-service docs and playground for developers."
  
  - question: "How do you handle webhook failures?"
    answer: "Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 5 retries). Dead letter queue for permanent failures. Webhook delivery monitoring and alerts. We guarantee at-least-once delivery with deduplication."
  
  - question: "What's your data retention policy?"
    answer: "Free: 7 days. Starter: 30 days. Growth: 90 days. Scale: 1 year. Enterprise: Custom (up to 7 years for compliance). GDPR-compliant data export/deletion APIs."
  
  - question: "How do you handle exceptions?"
    answer: "ML-powered auto-resolution (92% success rate). Configurable rules (exact, fuzzy, tolerance, date ranges). Manual review queue for unmatched transactions. Webhook notifications for exceptions."
  
  - question: "What's your integration process?"
    answer: "5-minute integration: (1) Sign up → Get API key, (2) Install SDK (`npm install @settler/sdk`), (3) Create job → Connect systems, (4) Run reconciliation → Get results, (5) Set up webhooks → Get notified. No complex setup."
  
  - question: "How do you handle high-volume customers?"
    answer: "Serverless architecture scales automatically. We support millions of transactions/month. Enterprise tier includes dedicated infrastructure, VPC peering, private endpoints. Custom SLAs (99.99% uptime)."
  
  - question: "What's your roadmap?"
    answer: "MVP complete (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks adapters). Public beta Month 2. v1.0 Month 4-6 (advanced matching, multi-currency, scheduled jobs). v1.5 Month 7-9 (ML anomaly detection, smart matching). v2.0 Month 10-12 (adapter marketplace, workflow builder)."
  
  - question: "How do you monetize?"
    answer: "Subscription revenue (80%) - tiered SaaS pricing. Overage fees (15%) - $0.01 per reconciliation beyond limits. Enterprise contracts (5%) - custom pricing, SLAs, compliance. Target: $600K ARR Year 1, $12M ARR Year 3."
  
  - question: "What's your team structure?"
    answer: "Founder (Scott Hardie - 10+ years developer tools, fintech). Hiring plan: Q1-Q2 (2 engineers), Q3 (1 designer), Q4 (1 sales/BD). Total: 5 people by end of Year 1."
  
  - question: "How do you handle security?"
    answer: "API keys with scoped permissions. JWT tokens for authentication. AES-256 encryption at rest. TLS 1.3 in transit. Row-level security for multi-tenant isolation. SOC 2 Type II by Month 9."
  
  - question: "What's your exit strategy?"
    answer: "Focus on building a great business. Potential acquirers: Payment platforms (Stripe, PayPal), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), enterprise software (Salesforce, Microsoft). Target: $100M+ exit in 5-7 years."
