# Task A: Pricing Strategist - Revenue Model Design
# Generated: January 2026

task: "A"
executive_summary: "Designed 3 pricing models (Pure Usage, Hybrid, Tiered) with 4 packages (Free, Starter, Growth, Enterprise). Primary value metric: reconciled_transactions. Hybrid model ($99/mo base + $0.005/txn) balances predictability with usage alignment. Tiered model ($49-$999+/mo) provides clear upgrade path for D2C/SaaS customers."

# A1. Value Metric Discovery
value_metrics:
  - name: "reconciled_transactions"
    description: "Primary unit of value - each matched transaction pair"
    unit_economics:
      cost_per_unit: "$0.001-0.003"
      willingness_to_pay: "$0.005-0.01 per transaction"
      rationale: "Directly correlates with customer value - more transactions = more value delivered"
    
  - name: "gateways_connected"
    description: "Number of payment/accounting platforms connected"
    unit_economics:
      cost_per_unit: "Negligible (API calls)"
      willingness_to_pay: "$10-20 per additional gateway"
      rationale: "Multi-platform complexity is a key pain point - more gateways = more value"
    
  - name: "exported_ledgers"
    description: "Number of ledger exports to accounting systems"
    unit_economics:
      cost_per_unit: "$0.01-0.05 per export"
      willingness_to_pay: "$0.10-0.50 per export"
      rationale: "Downstream value - automated exports save hours of manual work"
    
  - name: "exceptions_autoresolved_pct"
    description: "Percentage of exceptions automatically resolved"
    unit_economics:
      cost_per_unit: "ML compute costs"
      willingness_to_pay: "Premium pricing for >90% auto-resolution"
      rationale: "Automation quality - higher auto-resolution = less manual intervention"
    
  - name: "month_end_close_hours_saved"
    description: "Time saved during month-end close process"
    unit_economics:
      cost_per_unit: "Infrastructure costs"
      willingness_to_pay: "$50-200 per hour saved"
      rationale: "Time value - finance teams value speed and accuracy"

primary_value_metric: "reconciled_transactions"
rationale: "Most directly correlates with customer value and scales with business growth"

# A2. Model Comparison Matrix
pricing_models:
  - model_id: "pure_usage"
    name: "Pure Usage-Based"
    structure: "$0.01 per reconciled transaction"
    pros:
      - "Perfect alignment with value delivered"
      - "No upfront commitment - pay as you go"
      - "Scales automatically with customer growth"
      - "Simple to understand"
    cons:
      - "Unpredictable revenue for customers"
      - "High variance in monthly bills"
      - "May discourage usage (fear of overage)"
      - "Lower conversion (no free tier anchor)"
    best_for: "High-volume customers who want pure usage alignment"
    example:
      customer: "E-commerce processing 50K orders/month"
      monthly_cost: "$500/month"
      cost_per_transaction: "$0.01"
  
  - model_id: "hybrid"
    name: "Hybrid (Base + Usage)"
    structure: "$99/month base + $0.005 per transaction"
    pros:
      - "Predictable base revenue"
      - "Usage component aligns with value"
      - "Lower per-transaction cost encourages usage"
      - "Good for mid-market customers"
    cons:
      - "More complex to explain"
      - "Base fee may deter small customers"
      - "Need to balance base vs. usage pricing"
    best_for: "Mid-market SaaS and growing e-commerce ($1M-$50M ARR)"
    example:
      customer: "SaaS processing 10K transactions/month"
      base_cost: "$99"
      usage_cost: "$50"
      total_monthly_cost: "$149/month"
      cost_per_transaction: "$0.0149"
  
  - model_id: "tiered_seats"
    name: "Tiered Seats"
    structure: "Starter $49/mo, Growth $299/mo, Enterprise $999+/mo"
    pros:
      - "Clear upgrade path"
      - "Predictable pricing for customers"
      - "Easy to understand and sell"
      - "Good for self-service model"
    cons:
      - "May leave money on table (high-volume customers)"
      - "Price anchoring challenges"
      - "Less flexible than usage-based"
    best_for: "D2C CTOs and SaaS RevOps teams ($1M-$50M ARR)"
    example:
      starter:
        price: "$49/month"
        transactions: "10K/month"
        cost_per_1k: "$4.90"
      growth:
        price: "$299/month"
        transactions: "100K/month"
        cost_per_1k: "$2.99"
      enterprise:
        price: "$999+/month"
        transactions: "Unlimited"
        cost_per_1k: "Volume-dependent"

recommended_model: "tiered_seats"
rationale: "Best fit for D2C/SaaS ICP - clear upgrade path, predictable pricing, self-service friendly"
