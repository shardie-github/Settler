# Settler: Brand & Mission One-Pager

## Vision Statement

**"Make reconciliation as simple as sending an email."**

Settler eliminates the complexity of cross-platform financial data validation. Developers integrate once, configure adapters, and get automated reconciliation with real-time alerts, audit trails, and compliance guarantees—all through a single API.

---

## The Problem

Modern businesses operate across **10+ platforms** (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, NetSuite, custom databases, webhooks). Data inconsistencies cause:

- **Revenue Leakage**: Unmatched transactions = lost revenue
- **Compliance Risks**: Manual reconciliation fails audits
- **Operational Overhead**: Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily on reconciliation
- **Developer Friction**: Weeks of custom reconciliation logic that breaks

**The Market**: $2.3B reconciliation software market (2024), growing 12% YoY. Target: 50K+ SMBs and mid-market companies with multi-platform operations.

---

## Why Now?

1. **API Economy Maturity**: Every platform has APIs/webhooks (Stripe, Shopify, etc.)
2. **Serverless Infrastructure**: Lambda, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers enable global scale
3. **Developer-First Tools Success**: Stripe, Resend, Supabase prove API-first works
4. **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS are table stakes for SaaS
5. **E-commerce Growth**: Multi-platform operations are standard, not exception

---

## The Solution

**Reconciliation-as-a-Service (RaaS)** — A single API that normalizes, validates, and reconciles data across all sources in real-time.

### Core Principles

1. **API-First**: Everything accessible via REST APIs. No UI required (but we provide one).
2. **Composable**: Pluggable adapters for any platform. Open-source adapter SDK.
3. **Developer Experience**: `npm install @settler/sdk` → instant playground → production-ready.
4. **Transparency**: Every operation logged, queryable, and auditable.
5. **Compliance by Default**: GDPR, PCI-DSS Level 1, SOC 2 Type II ready out of the box.
