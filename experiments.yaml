# Task C: Experiment Orchestrator - Pricing A/B Tests
# Generated: January 2026

task: "C"
executive_summary: "Designed 5 parallel pricing experiments (Pure Usage vs Hybrid, Gateway limits, Pricing display, Free tier vs Trial, Per-txn vs Per-workspace). Defined North Star (LTV/CAC >3x), guardrails (40%+ activation, 70%+ Week 1 retention), and learning metrics. Implementation plan includes feature flags, analytics events, and sample sizes."

# C1. Test Matrix
experiments:
  - test_id: "exp_001"
    name: "Pure Usage vs Hybrid Pricing"
    hypothesis: "Hybrid pricing ($99/mo base + $0.005/txn) will have higher conversion than pure usage ($0.01/txn) due to predictable base revenue and lower perceived risk"
    variants:
      - name: "Control: Pure Usage"
        pricing: "$0.01 per reconciled transaction"
        structure: "No base fee, pure usage-based"
        target_segment: "All new signups"
      
      - name: "Variant A: Hybrid"
        pricing: "$99/month base + $0.005 per transaction"

    success_criteria: "Higher conversion rate, lower churn, higher LTV"
  
  - test_id: "exp_002"
    name: "3 Gateway Limit vs Unlimited (Starter Plan)"
    hypothesis: "Unlimited gateways on Starter plan will increase conversion and reduce upgrade friction, offsetting higher support costs"
    variants:
      - name: "Control: 3 Gateway Limit"
        plan: "Starter ($49/month)"
        gateway_limit: 3

  - test_id: "exp_003"
    name: "$49/month vs $99/quarter Pricing Display"
    hypothesis: "Quarterly pricing ($99/quarter = $33/month effective) will increase annual commitment and reduce churn, despite higher upfront cost"
    variants:
      - name: "Control: Monthly Pricing"
        display: "$49/month"
        billing: "Monthly"
        target_segment: "Starter plan checkout"

    test_location: "Checkout page"
    traffic_split: "50/50"
    duration: "90 days"
    sample_size: "300 users per variant (600 total)"
    success_criteria: "Higher conversion, lower churn, higher LTV"
  
  - test_id: "exp_004"
    name: "Free Tier vs 14-Day Trial"
    hypothesis: "Free tier (1K/month forever) will drive more signups and higher long-term conversion than 14-day trial (unlimited during trial)"
    variants:
      - name: "Control: Free Tier"
        offer: "1,000 reconciliations/month forever"

    duration: "120 days"
    sample_size: "1,000 users per variant (2,000 total)"
    success_criteria: "Higher signup rate, higher conversion to paid, higher LTV"
  
  - test_id: "exp_005"
    name: "Per-Transaction vs Per-Workspace Pricing"
    hypothesis: "Per-workspace pricing ($99/workspace/month) will appeal to multi-entity customers and increase ACV, despite lower transaction volume per workspace"
    variants:
      - name: "Control: Per-Transaction"
        pricing: "$0.01 per reconciliation"
        structure: "Usage-based"
        target_segment: "Growth plan prospects"
      
      - name: "Variant A: Per-Workspace"
        pricing: "$99 per workspace/month"

        includes: "100K transactions/workspace/month"

    traffic_split: "50/50"
    duration: "90 days"
    sample_size: "150 users per variant (300 total)"
    success_criteria: "Higher Growth plan conversion, higher ACV, lower churn"
