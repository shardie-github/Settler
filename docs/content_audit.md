## Per-Page Analysis

### 1. Homepage (`/`)

**File:** `packages/web/src/app/page.tsx`

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Hero Section (Lines 157-173)**
   - **Issue Type:** Jargon + Verbosity
   - **Location:** Hero heading and description
   - **Current Text:**
     - Heading: "Make Reconciliation As Simple As Email"
     - Description: "Automate financial data reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems. One API. All platforms. Real-time."
   - **Problems:**
     - "Reconciliation" is technical jargon (should be benefit-first)
     - "Fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems" is verbose
     - Doesn't clearly state the pain point or outcome
   - **Suggested Target:** Grade 7-9 reading level, 1-2 short sentences
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Heading: "Stop Wasting Hours on Manual Financial Matching"
     - Description: "Automatically match transactions between any platforms. Get accurate results in minutes, not hours."

2. **Features Section (Lines 38-75)**
   - **Issue Type:** Feature-focused, not benefit-focused
   - **Location:** Features grid
   - **Problems:**
     - "5-Minute Integration" - good, but could be more outcome-focused
     - "Enterprise Security" - jargon (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS mentioned elsewhere)
     - "Real-Time Processing" - technical term
     - "99.7% Accuracy" - good metric, but needs context
     - "50+ Integrations" - feature, not benefit
     - "Complete Visibility" - vague
   - **Recommendation:** Rewrite to focus on outcomes:
     - "Get Started in 5 Minutes" → "Save 10+ Hours Per Week"
     - "Enterprise Security" → "Bank-Level Security" (simpler)
     - "Real-Time Processing" → "See Results Instantly"
     - "99.7% Accuracy" → "99.7% Accurate - No More Manual Errors"
     - "50+ Integrations" → "Works with Your Existing Tools"
     - "Complete Visibility" → "See Every Transaction Matched"

3. **Code Example Section (Lines 268-301)**
   - **Issue Type:** Too technical for homepage
   - **Location:** Code block section
   - **Problems:**
     - Full code example on homepage may intimidate non-technical visitors
     - Technical details (adapters, configs) should be gated
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Show simplified preview with "View Full Example" CTA
     - Gate detailed code behind trial signup

4. **Edge AI Section (Line 358)**
   - **Issue Type:** Advanced feature may confuse top-of-funnel visitors
   - **Location:** EdgeAIMarketingSection component
   - **Recommendation:** Move to mid-funnel or gate as paid feature

#### Primary CTA Issues:

- Hero CTA links to `/playground` instead of direct trial signup
- Multiple CTAs compete for attention
- No clear "30-Day Free Trial" messaging

---

2. **Plan Descriptions (Lines 19-90)**
   - **Issue Type:** Technical limits, not outcomes

     - "2 platform adapters" - technical term
     - "7-day log retention" - technical detail
     - Features list is feature-focused, not benefit-focused
   - **Recommendation:** Add outcome context:
     - "1,000 reconciliations/month" → "Perfect for small businesses (up to ~1,000 transactions/month)"
     - "2 platform adapters" → "Connect 2 platforms (e.g., Shopify + Stripe)"

## Common Patterns & Recommendations

### Jargon to Replace:

- "Reconciliation" → "Matching transactions" or "Matching payments"
- "Reconciliation-as-a-Service API" → "Automatic transaction matching"
- "Fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems" → "Different platforms"
- "Platform adapters" → "Platform connections" or "Integrations"
- "Enterprise-Grade" → "Built for enterprise" or "Enterprise-ready"
- "Real-time processing" → "Instant results" or "See results immediately"

### Verbosity Issues:

- Long paragraphs should be split into 2-3 short sentences
- Feature lists should be bullet points, not paragraphs
- Technical explanations should be simplified or moved to docs

### Missing Elements:

- Clear "30-Day Free Trial" messaging on key pages
- Outcome-focused language (save time, reduce errors, increase accuracy)
- Clear free vs paid boundaries
- Social proof/testimonials with specific outcomes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2:** Map pages to funnel stages and define free vs paid content boundaries
2. **Phase 3:** Design 30-day trial cadence and conversion flow
3. **Phase 4:** Implement copy rewrites and content gating
