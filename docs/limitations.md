await settler.currency.syncRates({
  baseCurrency: "USD"
});
```

---

### Real-Time Processing

**Status:** Event-driven (not truly real-time)

**Current Behavior:**
- Scheduled jobs: ✅ Fully functional
- Webhook integration: ✅ Fully functional
- Instant processing: ❌ Not supported

**Reality:**
- Reconciliation runs on schedule (cron) or via webhook trigger
- Processing time: Typically 1-30 seconds depending on volume
- Not "instant" - requires job execution

**Clarification:** We use "event-driven" or "near real-time" terminology to be accurate.

## Accuracy & Matching

### Matching Accuracy

**Typical Accuracy:** 95-99% (varies by data quality and matching rules)

**Factors Affecting Accuracy:**
- Data quality in source systems
- Matching rule configuration
- Currency differences
- Date/time discrepancies
- Missing or incomplete data

**Improving Accuracy:**
- Fine-tune matching rules
- Use fuzzy matching for text fields
- Add date range tolerance
- Review and resolve exceptions regularly

**Note:** We don't guarantee specific accuracy percentages. Accuracy depends on your data and configuration.

---

### Unmatched Transactions

**Common Reasons:**
- Missing transactions in one system
- Data quality issues (typos, formatting)
- Currency conversion differences
- Date/time mismatches
- Duplicate transactions

**Handling:**
- Review exception queue regularly
- Adjust matching rules as needed
- Manually resolve exceptions
- Use custom matching functions (when available)

## Known Issues

### Issue #1: XLSX Export Not Implemented

**Impact:** Large exports may fail.

**Workaround:** 
- Use CSV export for large datasets
- Export in smaller date ranges
- Use pagination to process in batches

**Status:** Known limitation (will optimize in future)

---

### Issue #3: Onboarding Not Auto-Triggered

---

## Performance Considerations

### Large Volume Reconciliation

**Recommendations:**
- Use scheduled jobs for large volumes
- Process in batches if possible
- Monitor job execution time
- Contact support for volume > 1M transactions/month

### API Response Times

**Typical Response Times:**
- Job creation: < 500ms
- Job status: < 200ms
- Report generation: 1-5 seconds (depends on volume)
- Export generation: 2-10 seconds (depends on format and volume)

**Note:** Response times may vary based on system load and data volume.
