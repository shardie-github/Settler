# Security Audit Report

This document tracks security vulnerabilities found in dependencies and their resolution status.

## Audit Date
2025-01-XX

## Audit Command
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

## Summary

### High Priority Issues
- **Status**: Review required
- **Action**: Review and update vulnerable packages where safe

### Moderate Priority Issues
- **Status**: Review required
- **Action**: Update packages or document acceptable risk

### Low Priority Issues
- **Status**: Monitor
- **Action**: Update when convenient

## Known Vulnerabilities

### High Severity
- **jws <3.2.3** - Improperly Verifies HMAC Signature (CVE-2024-XXXX)
  - **Status**: Fix available via `npm audit fix`
  - **Action**: Run `npm audit fix` to update to jws >=3.2.3
  - **Impact**: Indirect dependency, affects JWT token verification
  - **Priority**: High - Should be fixed before next release

### Deprecated Packages (Informational)
The following packages are deprecated but may still be in use by dependencies:
- `npmlog` - Used by npm itself
- `lodash.isequal` - Consider using native alternatives
- `gauge` - Used by npm
- `fstream` - Used by npm
- `domexception` - Used by jsdom
- `crypto` - Node.js built-in (polyfill)
- `are-we-there-yet` - Used by npm
- `abab` - Used by jsdom
- `@shopify/network` - Check for updates
- `@humanwhocodes/object-schema` - Used by ESLint
- `@humanwhocodes/config-array` - Used by ESLint
- `@paypal/checkout-server-sdk` - Check for updates
- `eslint@8.57.1` - Consider upgrading to ESLint 9.x

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly and before releases
2. **Automated Scanning**: CI/CD pipeline includes security scanning
3. **Dependency Updates**: Review and update dependencies quarterly
4. **Patch Management**: Apply security patches promptly

## Resolution Process

1. Review vulnerability details: `npm audit`
2. Check if updates are available: `npm outdated`
3. Test updates in development environment
4. Update package.json and package-lock.json
5. Run full test suite
6. Document any breaking changes

## CI/CD Integration

Security scanning is integrated into CI/CD:
- GitHub Actions runs `npm audit` on every PR
- Critical vulnerabilities block merges
- Security reports are generated automatically

## Notes

- Some vulnerabilities may be in transitive dependencies
- Not all vulnerabilities can be immediately resolved (may require breaking changes)
- Document any accepted risks with justification
