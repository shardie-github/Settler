## What We Changed

### 1. Content Simplification & Clarity

**Homepage:**

- Hero changed from "Make Reconciliation As Simple As Email" to "Stop Wasting Hours on Manual Financial Matching"
- Removed technical jargon ("Reconciliation-as-a-Service API" → "Automatic Transaction Matching")
- Features rewritten to be outcome-focused:
  - "5-Minute Integration" → "Save 10+ Hours Per Week"
  - "Enterprise Security" → "Bank-Level Security"
  - "Real-Time Processing" → "See Results Instantly"
  - "99.7% Accuracy" → "99.7% Accurate - No More Manual Errors"

**All Pages:**

- Simplified language throughout (Grade 7-9 reading level)
- Removed buzzwords and acronym soup
- Focused on benefits, not features
- Clear "30-Day Free Trial" messaging everywhere

### 2. Funnel Structure

**New Funnel Mapping:**

- **Awareness:** Homepage focuses on problem/outcome
- **Consideration:** Docs, cookbooks, playground (with gating)
- **Conversion:** Pricing page emphasizes trial, signup page optimized
- **Retention:** Dashboard and in-app surfaces (pending implementation)

**Primary CTA:** "Start 30-Day Free Trial" (changed from "Start Free Trial")

- Links to `/signup` instead of `/playground`
- Added "No credit card required" messaging

### 3. Content Gating Architecture

**Created:**

- `config/plans.ts` - Plan configuration with feature flags
- `PlanFeatureGate` component - For gating content
- Content gating rules defined (free vs paid boundaries)

**Gating Strategy:**

- Free tier: Basic cookbooks and docs only
- Trial: Full access to everything (30 days)
- Paid: Full access + consulting + priority support

**Note:** Gating components created but not yet applied (requires user plan context integration)

### 4. Trial Structure

**30-Day Free Trial:**

- No credit card required (recommended)
- Full access to all features during trial
- Clear messaging about trial benefits
