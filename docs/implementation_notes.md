## Feature Flags / Config Added

### Plan Configuration (`config/plans.ts`)

**Structure:**
- Plan types: `free`, `trial`, `commercial`, `enterprise`
- Feature access levels per plan
- Content gating rules
- Plan limits (reconciliations, retention, adapters)

**Key Functions:**
- `hasFeatureAccess()` - Check if user has access to specific feature
- `getPlanLimits()` - Get plan limits for user
- `isContentGated()` - Check if content should be gated

## Content Gating Implementation

### Current Gating Rules:

**Free Tier Gated:**
- Advanced cookbooks: `realtime-webhooks`, `multi-currency`, `dashboard-metrics`, `api-key-management`
- Advanced docs: `api-reference-advanced`, `webhooks`, `multi-currency`, `edge-ai`

**Trial/Paid Access:**
- Full access to all content during trial
- Full access to all content on paid plans

### Implementation Status:

- ✅ Plan configuration created
- ✅ Gating component created
- ⚠️ Gating not yet applied to cookbooks/docs pages (pending user plan context)
- ⚠️ User plan context not yet integrated (requires auth/user state)
